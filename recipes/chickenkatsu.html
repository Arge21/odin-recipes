        Description
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.

        <li>
            Seasonings: This chicken katsu recipe is simply     seasoned with salt and pepper.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Flour: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Egg: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Panko: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Oil: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.
